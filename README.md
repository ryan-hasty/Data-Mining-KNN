Implementing K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm

This program implements the K-Nearest-Neighbor Supervised learning algorithm completely from scratch.
It does not utilize libraries such as scikitlearn that are able to run the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm.
Dr. Chen wanted us to understand how the algorithm worked on such a level that we were able to create it.
This program runs on multiple csv files full of wines. One file contains known scoring, and the other does not have any scoring.
This program predicts the scores of the unknown wines(testing data) using the known wines(training data)
